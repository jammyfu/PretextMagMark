# Pretext

Pure JavaScript/TypeScript library for multiline text measurement & layout. Fast, accurate & supports all the languages you didn't even know about. Allows rendering to DOM, Canvas, SVG and soon, server-side.

Pretext side-steps the need for DOM measurements (e.g. `getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetHeight`), which trigger layout reflow, one of the most expensive operations in the browser. It implements its own text measurement logic, using the browsers' own font engine as ground truth (very AI-friendly iteration method).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @chenglou/pretext
```

## Demos

Clone the repo, run `bun install`, then `bun start`, and open the `/demos` in your browser (no trailing slash. Bun devserver bugs on those)
Alternatively, see them live at [chenglou.me/pretext](https://chenglou.me/pretext/). Some more at [somnai-dreams.github.io/pretext-demos](https://somnai-dreams.github.io/pretext-demos/)

### Markdown Poster Demo

This repo now also includes a browser demo for turning Markdown into:
- Xiaohongshu-style multi-page cards (`1080 x 1440`)
- a single long image (`1080 x auto`)

Open `/demos/markdown-poster` after starting the demo server.

The implementation lives in:
- [pages/demos/markdown-poster.html](pages/demos/markdown-poster.html)
- [pages/demos/markdown-poster.ts](pages/demos/markdown-poster.ts)

What it currently supports:
- importing a local `.md` file
- direct editing in a textarea
- headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, ordered/unordered lists, fenced code blocks, dividers
- Markdown image syntax as layout placeholders
- theme switching
- `2x` / `3x` / `4x` PNG export

What it deliberately does not do yet:
- WeChat embedded article HTML composition
- real image asset drawing for Markdown image nodes; those are placeholder blocks for now

#### How It Works

The demo uses Pretext as the line layout engine rather than relying on DOM text measurement.

Pipeline:
1. Parse Markdown into a small block model in userland.
2. Convert each block into styled inline spans.
3. For each text style, call `prepareWithSegments(text, font)` once and cache the result.
4. Use `layoutNextLine()` to stream each rendered line at the current available width.
5. Assemble the lines into block rows with explicit `x / y / height` geometry.
6. For Xiaohongshu mode, paginate those rows into fixed-height `1080 x 1440` pages.
7. For long-image mode, keep the rows in one continuous document and derive the final height from content.
8. Draw the final geometry into a canvas and export PNG from the canvas bitmap.

Why this structure:
- line breaking stays aligned with the repo's current Pretext behavior
- no DOM measurement loop is needed for text layout
- pagination and export stay deterministic because all geometry is explicit before drawing
- the same layout pipeline can target multiple output sizes without changing the text engine

#### How To Use It

1. Install dependencies with `bun install`.
2. Start the demo server with `bun start`.
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/demos/markdown-poster`.
4. Import a Markdown file or paste Markdown into the editor.
5. Choose `Xiaohongshu` or `Long Image`.
6. Choose theme and export scale.
7. Click `重新排版` to rebuild the layout.
8. Click `导出当前 PNG` or `导出全部页`.

Practical notes:
- `3x` is the default high-resolution export mode.
- `4x` is sharper but costs more memory and can be slower on large long images.
- in Xiaohongshu mode, `导出全部页` downloads one PNG per page.
- in long-image mode, export is a single PNG whose height is content-driven.

#### How To Test It

There is no dedicated automated test for this demo yet, so verify it manually in the browser.

Recommended manual checks:
- load the sample content and confirm both presets render without overlap or clipping
- import a real `.md` file and confirm headings, lists, quotes, and fenced code blocks all appear
- switch between `Xiaohongshu` and `Long Image` and verify page count / final height updates
- export at `2x`, `3x`, and `4x` and confirm the downloaded PNG dimensions scale as expected
- confirm `导出全部页` is only enabled for Xiaohongshu mode
- add a Markdown image node such as `![caption](./cover.png)` and confirm it renders as a placeholder card
- resize the browser and confirm the preview still matches the chosen output size rather than the viewport size

If you change the demo's layout rules, styles, parsing, or export behavior, re-run those checks before merging.

## API

Pretext serves 2 use cases:

### 1. Measure a paragraph's height _without ever touching DOM_

```ts
import { prepare, layout } from '@chenglou/pretext'

const prepared = prepare('AGI 春天到了. بدأت الرحلة 🚀', '16px Inter')
const { height, lineCount } = layout(prepared, textWidth, 20) // pure arithmetics. No DOM layout & reflow!
```

`prepare()` does the one-time work: normalize whitespace, segment the text, apply glue rules, measure the segments with canvas, and return an opaque handle. `layout()` is the cheap hot path after that: pure arithmetic over cached widths. Do not rerun `prepare()` for the same text and configs; that'd defeat its precomputation. For example, on resize, only rerun `layout()`.

If you want textarea-like text where ordinary spaces, `\t` tabs, and `\n` hard breaks stay visible, pass `{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }` to `prepare()`:

```ts
const prepared = prepare(textareaValue, '16px Inter', { whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' })
const { height } = layout(prepared, textareaWidth, 20)
```

On the current checked-in benchmark snapshot:
- `prepare()` is about `19ms` for the shared 500-text batch
- `layout()` is about `0.09ms` for that same batch

We support all the languages you can imagine, including emojis and mixed-bidi, and caters to specific browser quirks

The returned height is the crucial last piece for unlocking web UI's:
- proper virtualization/occlusion without guesstimates & caching
- fancy userland layouts: masonry, JS-driven flexbox-like implementations, nudging a few layout values without CSS hacks (imagine that), etc.
- _development time_ verification (especially now with AI) that labels on e.g. buttons don't overflow to the next line, browser-free
- prevent layout shift when new text loads and you wanna re-anchor the scroll position

### 2. Lay out the paragraph lines manually yourself

Switch out `prepare` with `prepareWithSegments`, then:

- `layoutWithLines()` gives you all the lines at a fixed width:

```ts
import { prepareWithSegments, layoutWithLines } from '@chenglou/pretext'

const prepared = prepareWithSegments('AGI 春天到了. بدأت الرحلة 🚀', '18px "Helvetica Neue"')
const { lines } = layoutWithLines(prepared, 320, 26) // 320px max width, 26px line height
for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) ctx.fillText(lines[i].text, 0, i * 26)
```

- `walkLineRanges()` gives you line widths and cursors without building the text strings:

```ts
let maxW = 0
walkLineRanges(prepared, 320, line => { if (line.width > maxW) maxW = line.width })
// maxW is now the widest line — the tightest container width that still fits the text! This multiline "shrink wrap" has been missing from web
```

- `layoutNextLine()` lets you route text one row at a time when width changes as you go:

```ts
let cursor = { segmentIndex: 0, graphemeIndex: 0 }
let y = 0

// Flow text around a floated image: lines beside the image are narrower
while (true) {
  const width = y < image.bottom ? columnWidth - image.width : columnWidth
  const line = layoutNextLine(prepared, cursor, width)
  if (line === null) break
  ctx.fillText(line.text, 0, y)
  cursor = line.end
  y += 26
}
```

This usage allows rendering to canvas, SVG, WebGL and (eventually) server-side.

### API Glossary

Use-case 1 APIs:
```ts
prepare(text: string, font: string, options?: { whiteSpace?: 'normal' | 'pre-wrap' }): PreparedText // one-time text analysis + measurement pass, returns an opaque value to pass to `layout()`. Make sure `font` is synced with your css `font` declaration shorthand (e.g. size, weight, style, family) for the text you're measuring. `font` is the same format as what you'd use for `myCanvasContext.font = ...`, e.g. `16px Inter`.
layout(prepared: PreparedText, maxWidth: number, lineHeight: number): { height: number, lineCount: number } // calculates text height given a max width and lineHeight. Make sure `lineHeight` is synced with your css `line-height` declaration for the text you're measuring.
```

Use-case 2 APIs:
```ts
prepareWithSegments(text: string, font: string, options?: { whiteSpace?: 'normal' | 'pre-wrap' }): PreparedTextWithSegments // same as `prepare()`, but returns a richer structure for manual line layouts needs
layoutWithLines(prepared: PreparedTextWithSegments, maxWidth: number, lineHeight: number): { height: number, lineCount: number, lines: LayoutLine[] } // high-level api for manual layout needs. Accepts a fixed max width for all lines. Similar to `layout()`'s return, but additionally returns the lines info
walkLineRanges(prepared: PreparedTextWithSegments, maxWidth: number, onLine: (line: LayoutLineRange) => void): number // low-level api for manual layout needs. Accepts a fixed max width for all lines. Calls `onLine` once per line with its actual calculated line width and start/end cursors, without building line text strings. Very useful for certain cases where you wanna speculatively test a few width and height boundaries (e.g. binary search a nice width value by repeatedly calling walkLineRanges and checking the line count, and therefore height, is "nice" too. You can have text messages shrinkwrap and balanced text layout this way). After walkLineRanges calls, you'd call layoutWithLines once, with your satisfying max width, to get the actual lines info.
layoutNextLine(prepared: PreparedTextWithSegments, start: LayoutCursor, maxWidth: number): LayoutLine | null // iterator-like api for laying out each line with a different width! Returns the LayoutLine starting from `start`, or `null` when the paragraph's exhausted. Pass the previous line's `end` cursor as the next `start`.
type LayoutLine = {
  text: string // Full text content of this line, e.g. 'hello world'
  width: number // Measured width of this line, e.g. 87.5
  start: LayoutCursor // Inclusive start cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
  end: LayoutCursor // Exclusive end cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
}
type LayoutLineRange = {
  width: number // Measured width of this line, e.g. 87.5
  start: LayoutCursor // Inclusive start cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
  end: LayoutCursor // Exclusive end cursor in prepared segments/graphemes
}
type LayoutCursor = {
  segmentIndex: number // Segment index in prepareWithSegments' prepared rich segment stream
  graphemeIndex: number // Grapheme index within that segment; `0` at segment boundaries
}
```

Other helpers:
```ts
clearCache(): void // clears Pretext's shared internal caches used by prepare() and prepareWithSegments(). Useful if your app cycles through many different fonts or text variants and you want to release the accumulated cache
setLocale(locale?: string): void // optional (by default we use the current locale). Sets locale for future prepare() and prepareWithSegments(). Internally, it also calls clearCache(). Setting a new locale doesn't affect existing prepare() and prepareWithSegments() states (no mutations to them)
```

## Caveats

Pretext doesn't try to be a full font rendering engine (yet?). It currently targets the common text setup:
- `white-space: normal`
- `word-break: normal`
- `overflow-wrap: break-word`
- `line-break: auto`
- If you pass `{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }`, ordinary spaces, `\t` tabs, and `\n` hard breaks are preserved instead of collapsed. Tabs follow the default browser-style `tab-size: 8`. The other wrapping defaults stay the same: `word-break: normal`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, and `line-break: auto`.
- `system-ui` is unsafe for `layout()` accuracy on macOS. Use a named font.
- Because the default target includes `overflow-wrap: break-word`, very narrow widths can still break inside words, but only at grapheme boundaries.
